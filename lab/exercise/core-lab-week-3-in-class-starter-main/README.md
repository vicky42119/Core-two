## How to download this code:

Press the green "Code" button on this repo. Choose "Download Zip" which will download the files to your Downloads folder. Unzip it and grab the files from the `starter-code` folder and begin!

I suggest adding the files in the `starter-code` folder directly your class repo in your lab folder. You'll need to upload the final version to github to be graded for completion and accuracy.
