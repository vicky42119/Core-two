                <h5>Technocapitalism refers to changes in capitalism associated with the emergence of new technology sectors, the power of corporations, and new forms of organization. The problem with technocapitalism revolves around the fact that information is now controlled by the limited number of companies who are participating in tech driven markets.</h5>

                <h2>
                    In capitalism, science is considered an essential tool of knowledge from which technology feeds, as production can be considered as nothing other than a technological application of science. According to professor Luis Suarez Villa, “Continuous invention and innovation involve coming up with streams of new discoveries over a limited period of time.  For the kinds of organisations that are typical of Technocapitalism - the experimentalist organisations - continuous invention and innovation are vital necessities.”
Technological innovation, which consists of introduction to the market of new goods, services, new tools, processes and production methods, can play a key role in explaining economic growth cycles or, better, economic movements. Indeed, innovations cause an increase in the demand for the means of production, a reduction in the costs of production thanks to the introduction of machines that save labor and reduce the cost of production.

                    For as long as there has been currency, humans have been exploring “get rich quick” schemes. In this era, tech is the gold rush. In fact, according to Forbes, ventures in the Tech Industry offer better pay opportunities, as they pay an average of $102,000 more than double the current U.S. average of $48,000. With budding sub-industries like NFTs, big data, and gaming growing everywhere everyone wants their slice of the pie. 
                    A direct quote from ITIF tells us that “The number of technology-based start-ups surged 47 percent in the last decade. These firms still account for a relatively small share of all businesses, but they have an outsized impact on economic growth because they provide better-paying, longer-lasting jobs than other start-ups, and they contribute more to innovation, productivity, and competitiveness.”

                <h2>
                    In a perfect world, these can only be seen as positives, however, with every potential reward, the risk is there to match. It is widely said that nine out of ten startups are destined to fail. Of course, the word “fail” is open to interpretation, employees who are cautious about what contracts they sign can minimize their risk by working for a fixed salary and forfeit equity and potential for income growth should the company see success.  This means that any risk falls on the founding team while employees can be somewhat comfortable knowing they have a stable income.

                    Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, these are just some of the biggest tech companies that exist in our time. While they may not be considered monopolies, the power they hold on society is still great. Their power can be split up into 3 different categories; economic, political, and technological. 
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Economic Power:
                    The five American tech giants known in Europe as FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) hold a market share of $2.4 trillion, a sum that’s around the GDP of France. While that’s great news for them, it's important we look into how this is affecting the majority in the economy. In the United States economy 10 percent of big tech companies accumulate 80 percent of profit. Jeff Bezos the CEO of Amazon has accumulated a net worth of $130.2 billion an insane amount for only one person. If you take a look at the chart linked you can understand the actual scale of this massive accumulation in wealth. With this amount of money Jeff Bezos could cover the cost of chemotherapy for all cancer patients which for him would cost him under $9 billion which is still a lot of money to be fair, although this amount of wealth although on July 20th of 2020 he made $13 billion in a single day. No one needs that much money.                 </h2>
                <h2>
                    Political Power:
                    Big businesses have been using their power to influence politics for a while so things are no different for tech giants. Most of that power comes from lobbying policy makers. The New Statesman has recently found that tech giants are the 4th highest spending sector in U.S. federal lobbying in 2021 having spent approximately $463 million, in which nearly a quarter of was spent by only 15 companies. Another influence tech giants have on politics is through their customer base. Blavatnik chair in government and public policy at the University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of government, who researches the political power of businesses explains, “These companies have made people’s lives so much easier through the innovation they’ve created, and that creates a tacit alliance with consumers.”                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Technological Power:
                    Finally the most unique form of power tech giants hold is through technology itself. Technology has become such an integral part of our modern society. It’s how we get our news, connect with others, entertain ourselves, and so much more. Having the power in the design of our technology is significant on its own. One of the most controversial forms of this power comes from targeted algorithms and data collection. Big tech companies can target and influence what you see on your screen through data they’ve collected on you. This can be used in targeted advertisements, by trying to sell you something they think you’ll like. This can be done by collecting cookies for certain browsers or through social media algorithms. Not only can you sell a tangible product but these algorithms can also sell you on ideas. An example of this can be looked at through research from the University of Washington which found that Amazon allegedly used algorithms to promote vaccine misinformation. So while we may think algorithms can be harmless which may be true in some cases they also have the potential to be used in a harmful way.

                With the introduction of new technologies capitalism has adapted with it. Whether it's the rate of exploitation or how technology is used to make us addicted to our devices, it's everywhere. Exploitation has always been a key ingredient in how capitalism works and with how new technology is made it is no different. For instance, If we take a look at the production of an iphone, the exploitation is extremely evident. If the iPhone X was made in the U.S. it would be extremely unaffordable to most people. According to the Institute of Social Research, if the iPhone x was manufactured in the U.S. it would cost an estimate of $30,000 per phone. Yet today the iPhone X price starts at only $999, that's $29,001 less than the estimate of one made in the U.S. So how is this fair? The answer is it's not, it's just capitalism.             </h2>
            <h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">
                The issue with capitalism is that exploitation isn’t an extraordinary concept, it's one of the building blocks of the economic system. The goal of capitalism is to squeeze as much profit out as possible and this is why the iPhone x like many other apple products are made outside of the U.S. The main reasons for this are the cost of labor being much cheaper as well as the adverse working conditions. Meaning that in other countries such as China there are no trade unions and longer working hours. Apple also pays only around 2% in taxes along the Global Commodity Chain compared to the 35% they would have to pay if the iPhone was produced in the U.S. One of the biggest weapons in reducing the cost of production is through mechanization which is the investment in new technology to speed up production. New technology is used in order to increase and manage labor productivity. This ultimately leads to the idea of labor productivity which forces workers to increase their labor intensity for the same pay.
            </h2>
            <h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">
                Amazon has one of the most obvious ways of using technology as mechanization to increase productivity in their workers. Amazon uses computers to track the amount of work you’ve done in comparison to the expected goal. Ilya Geller who previously worked for Amazon as a stower explained how they exploit their employees through mechanization, ‘“You’re being tracked by a computer the entire time you’re there. You don’t get reported or written up by managers. You get written up by an algorithm,” said Geller. “You’re keenly aware there is an algorithm keeping track of you, making sure you keep going as fast as you can, because if there is too much time lapsed between items, the computer will know this, will write you up, and you will get fired.”’ Geller also mentioned that it only takes 2 to 3 write ups to get fired. Many workers have testified to Amazon’s grueling working conditions. Workers are expected to scan 1,800 packages an hour which equals to scanning 30 packages per minute. Being constantly watched by machines and bordered off from speaking to other coworkers. Employees have compared working there to a prison with their extremely short break times, high injury rates and putting machines above their actual workers.

            <h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">
                In the end we see advancement in technology has only brought upon increasing the rate of exploitation along with use of exploitation in technology production.            </h2>

            <h2>
                NFT is an acronym for Non-Fungible Token. This marks the property that we hold on a unique object, not exchangeable for an object of the same type. NFTs are linked to a huge technological innovation: the blockchain. The blockchain is a database, created jointly by coders, open to all, tamper-proof and destined to last forever. NFTs therefore make it possible to create a title deed on an object and to register it in a block chain which guarantees its possession in the eyes of all and this, as long as the block chain is active. The incredible innovation of NFTs therefore lies in the fact of doing without a third party who would come to guarantee the transaction or membership.
                Now, if we accept that capitalism is a system of sharing value based on private property, then NFTs, by making private what could not be, will extend the influence of capitalism, will create new markets. NFT technology is on the way to becoming the new dominant part of capitalism, which demonstrates – once again – its ability to transform itself and its environment through technology. </h2>
                <h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">
                    Often bought through cryptocurrency, NFTs are created through Graphic Art, GIFS, videos and sports highlights, Music, Virtual Avatars, Designer Sneakers, and many more art collectibles.
                    NFTs are collectible items you have exclusive ownership of, and the buyer gets a digital file. Nowadays, depending on what NFT you bought, you can also receive a physical copy.  Some people think that investing in NFTs is uncertain and risky, but as a creator, NFT is great for creators/artists to expose and sell their art.
